# Classic Computer Science Problems in Java
This repository contains source code to accompany the book *Classic Computer Science Problems in Java* by David Kopec, [now available in early access form from Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-java?a_aid=oaksnow&a_bid=6430148a). You will find the source organized by chapter. **As you read the book, each code listing contains a file name that corresponds to a file in this repository.** The book is due for publication in late 2020.

## Conventions
The source code was written against version 11 of the Java language and should run on any known newer version at the time of publication. It makes use of no Java libraries beyond the standard library. It was developed in Eclipse and this folder can be opened as an Eclipse workspace. You can then right-click any file with a `main()` method and select "Run" to compile and execute it. All other popular Java IDEs can import Eclipse projects, but you can also easily create a project out of each chapter, which is bundled as a Java package. For directions importing Eclipse projects into IntelliJ see [this tutorial from Jetbrains.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/import-project-from-eclipse-page-1.html)
